# Safehouse Together

This mod is intended to allow people to have multiple safe zones. They can be the owners of their own shelters, but at the same time, be invited by their friends, and be part of their friends' shelter as well. That way, you can help them to build, repair or even take care of their houses, in case they are not connected.

It also allows you to claim plots or land without having to have a building on them. Simply obtain the item set by the server and head to the central point, where you can claim the land. The limit is also set by the server.
