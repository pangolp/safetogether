title=Safehouse Together
description=This mod is intended to allow people to have multiple safe zones. They can be the owners of their own shelters, but at the same time, be invited by their friends, and be part of their friends' shelter as well. That way, you can help them to build, repair or even take care of their houses, in case they are not connected.
